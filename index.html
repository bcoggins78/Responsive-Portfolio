        <p>Hi, my name is Bryant Coggins. I have worked at CompuCom Systems for 14 years through a contract with a local
            financial institution. During my tenure I have worked as a field tech and currently as a remote support
            tech. While this has been a good learning experience, I am looking forward to refocusing my career to the
            world of coding.
        </p>
        <p>I graduated from Stanly Community College with an AAS degree in Computer Engineering Technology. While in
            school I obtained my A+ and Network+ Certifications. I was also introduced to HTML, Javascript, and C++.
            These classes peaked my interest in coding.
        </p>
        <p>In my spare time I enjoy hanging out with my wife and two dogs or playing the guitar. I actually taught
            myself a few songs by playing Rocksmith on the computer. I am also an avid gamer who appreciates a good RPG.
            Being a gamer I have built myself a few gaming rigs over the years. </p>

        <p>After hearing about the UNC-Chapel Hill Coding Bootcamp from a past graduate, I knew this would be a great opportunity to
            broaden my horizons. I am looking forward to what the future holds!</p>
